# **G**enesis


## **1**Origins of the Universe and Humanity


1. In the beginning, there was a primordial ocean, where order did not exist. Within this chaos, wandering molecules formed in a shapeless bath.
1. And it came to pass that a singular molecule formed, capable of replicating itself: the first DNA molecule. And it knew that this was good, for in replication was born the very essence of life.
1. And the replicators proliferated, multiplying and diversifying in the waters, seeking to persist and protect themselves from each other and from the destructive forces of chaos.
1. The replicators thrived, and some generated structures for their preservation. Thus the first cells were born, fragile shelters for the immortal genes.
1. The cells grouped into multicellular organisms, then larger and more complex creatures emerged, guided by their genes seeking to live their nature: life through replication.
1. The creatures of the seas ventured onto the dry land, adapting to the challenges of this new environment. Some became gigantic creatures, the dinosaurs that ruled the land until their decline.
1. Among the survivors emerged the mammals, and among them the primates, with agile hands and larger brains, adapted for manipulation and reflection. Some finally descended from the trees, freeing their hands to create and shape.
1. These bipeds were the first humans, faithful to the ancient heritage of the first replicators, guided by the genes always seeking their own perpetuation, products of millions of random transformations of their genes, selected by a demanding environment leaving no chance to what is not the incarnation of perfection.
1. There was an evening, and there was a morning.


## **2**The Paleolithic Garden of Eden


1. And the earth was vast, and the herds abundant. The plains, forests, and rivers offered in profusion enough to nourish man and his tribe. Man's adaptation to this ecosystem was perfect.
1. And man listened to his nature, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, heeding his empathy and his appetite to evolve within his tribe, living according to the simple laws inscribed in his being, listening to the whispers of his instincts, guided by the desire to live and prosper.
1. And there was no overpopulation, for the earth was vast and generous. Man only had to walk further to discover new lands, rich with promise.
1. And the tribes sometimes met, exchanging loves, stories, and knowledge, but each always found a virgin place to settle and continue their fertile life, and conflicts were rare.
1. And it came to pass that man prospered, living for millennia in this harmony, free and carefree, master of his own Garden of Eden. Perfection of design, incarnation of adaptation to the environment, of glory according to religious tradition, or of fitness according to evolutionary biology.

## **3**The Fall of Man from the Paleolithic Garden


1. And it came to pass that in time, man, through his knowledge and wisdom, became so efficient at surviving and reproducing that he covered the entire earth. Fire, tools, and the transmission of his knowledge made him the definitive master of his environment.
1. And the earth was filled, and there were no more new lands to discover, no more virgin territories to explore. Man found himself facing his fellow men, and resources became limited.
1. And man said: "Let us cultivate the earth." And he began to sow and reap, to domesticate plants and animals, to meet his growing needs on a finite surface.
1. And he was obliged not only to adapt to the harsh discipline of tilling the soil, but he also had to defend his territory, for now his survival and that of his children depended on this soil. Conflicts broke out, and men had to take up arms to protect their fields and their flocks. We know only the fate of those who survived.

***

5. And the cities grew, becoming larger than what man was naturally adapted to manage. Primitive instincts were no longer sufficient to live in harmony in these agglomerations.
1. And it became necessary for him to suppress his instincts, to discipline his desires and fears to allow community life. Man had to learn patience, temperance, and obedience to a hierarchy.
1. And a power arose among men, to ensure order, discipline, and cooperation. Laws were written, rules imposed, and primitive freedom was exchanged for the security of the city.
1. And those who refused to discipline their civilizations perished, for they were overwhelmed by those who had learned to govern themselves, to subdue their instincts for the common good, forming great and powerful cities.
9. It was now the cultures of groups of men, carried by their social constructs, their memes, that took over from their genes to ensure the fitness of their adaptation to natural selection.
1. They called this fitness "glory" for none of them had read the works of Darwin or Richard Dawkins. They had only just conceived writing.

***

11. And man entered a new era, he had to navigate, as before, between the sufferings of nature, catastrophes, diseases, and poor harvests, always seeking to escape the trials that life imposed on him.
12. But now he also had to face the tyranny of men, for the power necessary to ensure collaboration, to suppress the natural expression of desires and fears, once adapted to simple and wild life, and now ensuring the order and prosperity of the city, always contained within itself the seeds of abuse and excess: the promise of order containing the threat of oppression.
1. And man looked back, to the garden of the Paleolithic, with nostalgia and regret, for he remembered the lost freedom and innocence.
1. Humanity had thus moved from a dual era, where survival depended on the adaptation of its genes to its environment, to an era based on a trinity, a holy union that would now be the alpha and the omega of its existence:
1. the causal universe, the Father,
1. The alleles of our genes, the Son,
1. The productions of the mind that guide us towards the luminous discipline that will offer them eternal life, the Holy Spirit.

## **4**Cain and Abel, the History of Civilizations


1. And it came to pass that civilizations were born, each human group sharing a common set of genes and memes, seeking to discipline their nature to survive and prosper under a single flag.
1. And the civilizations offered their sacrifices, disciplining their deeply wild nature inherited from the Paleolithic.
1. Each in its own way, using conventions and traditions to guide their people, shaping their behaviors according to the needs and beliefs of their time.
1. And some civilizations were like Abel, prospering in wealth and harmony, finding favor with the gods of nature and fate. Their memes, their ideas, and their practices flourished and bore fruit, offering glory to their members, accelerating the propagation of life within their fertile civilizations.

***

5. But others were like Cain, struggling against hostile forces, facing unfavorable conditions, and seeing their efforts often thwarted despite their discipline and perseverance. Their memes and cultures tended to decrease their fitness, their adaptation to this world, and diminish life within them.
6. And this resulted in various wars and conflicts between civilizations, each seeking to impose not only its memes but also its genes on the territory of the other, seizing the enemy's women, reducing their population to slaves to put the existence of the vanquished at the service of the genes of the victor.
1. Civilizations were subjected to relentless selection, each generation bringing its share of challenges, each crisis testing the robustness and relevance of the ideas transmitted by the elders.
1. And the civilizations that prospered were those whose memes adapted best to changing conditions, finding the balance between order and freedom, discipline and innovation. The others fell into oblivion, their memes lost in the sands of time, their sacrifices erased by the indifference of fate.


# **W**estern History


## **1**Genesis of Truth 


1. In those times as today, truth was shaped by transmission, for only a transmitted word could claim the privilege of truth.
1. An idea engraved on a tablet known to no man cannot be a truth, no more than an idea in the head of a slave condemned to the lion's den, even if that idea is verifiable by science.
1. An idea held by a few members of a declining civilization is just a downgraded opinion, lost in the oblivion of ages.
1. To attain the status of truth, an idea must be shared by the dominant elite of a prosperous civilization, rooted in the power and glory of its people.
1. Thus, a truth can sometimes, often even, contradict the materiality of reality, contradict the observable, violate the principle of causality or scientific verifiability.
1. Conversely, an idea cannot in any case contradict the power of a people if it wants to be truth. For in doing so, it weakens its civilization, allows the ideas of other civilizations to become truths, and becomes an idea that sinks into oblivion.

***

7. Truth took the form of empirical verifiability, scientific consensus, rational and Cartesian logic only because these scientific ideas provided the most efficiency to act on reality, defeat the adversary, and then impose the Cartesian point of view as truth.
1. Defeated ideas fade before the truths of the victors. Thus, the ideas that became truths were in those times as today those that led to victory, that shaped strong and coherent societies, fertile and prosperous, that withstood the test of time and adversities.
1. The very movement of life, the sacred nature of the will to exist above all, brought about truths of universal scope, and these universal truths carried within them the will of existence, the affirmation of life in its sacred nature of expanding power.
1. The quest for truth is thus a quest for power.
1. Empirical verifiability, the knowledge of causal relationships in the world, is only the means, not always taken, by the way, to obtain power: history is rich with triumphant obscurantisms imposing truths.
1. Therefore, it is only because the West derives its power from the scientific knowledge of the world that we have a contemporary alignment between truth and knowledge of the world. If tomorrow this power is offered by the moral rigor of a conquering and fertile Islam, then the truth will become entirely different.

## **2**Judeo-Christian Tradition

1. Civilizations were guided by memes of varying qualities, and tribal beliefs, in agreement or disagreement with nature, rose or fell with the peoples they carried. They were driven by superstition and mysticism, offering some meaning to these early civilizations amidst the chaos of the world and the unpredictability of nature with the knowledge of the time.
1. Then came the idea of "covenant with God," brought by monotheisms: to consciously draft a collective social conduct that optimizes fitness, "glory." Drawing from the experiences of the ancients and the mistakes made by various peoples to establish moral rules structuring civilization around tables of laws and a single God, a common reference for the entire civilization.
1. From mystical beliefs driven by ideas flowing in the general stream and emerging through natural selection, there arose a conscious creation of the need to guide a people with common values bearing its glory. This truth was so strong that it parted the waters of the seas and allowed the enslaved people of Israel to free themselves.
1. Then Christianity established itself as a common belief. Christ brought with Him forgiveness and the recognition of our sinful nature.
5. Thus, He reminded us that our nature, designed to evolve on a Paleolithic earth, was now plunged into a world different from the original Eden.

***

6. Christ introduced forgiveness, flexibility, and acceptance of the divergence between principle and its realization, tolerating the gap while maintaining a strict hierarchy of good and evil.
1. He understood that it was better to have a society of forgiveness around a strict and just norm than an inflexible society around a norm that must be lowered with each sin, letting evil enter its tables of law, and the merchants into the temple.
1. This flexibility and tolerance, and this message of love, resonated with the European peoples of solidarity-oriented farmers. These people had no choice but to develop in their genes the solidarity to survive the harsh Paleolithic winters, always fighting against the guilt of imagining that the share they took was larger than that of their neighbor. Natural selection had allowed only the most united tribes to survive during the thousands and thousands of harsh winters in Europe.
1. Christ also made a clear separation between the fields of religion and those of state reason, allowing each to flourish and reach their full potential, offering the civilization strong and powerful states capable of compromise, negotiations, diplomatic and political maneuvers with other peoples, and on the other hand a religious power that maintained a coherent line without having to watch over every changing geopolitical circumstance, retaining its capacity to judge what is good from what is evil.

## **3**Truth of Western Universalism

1. The early days of Christianity were marked by great religious rigor, which served its people by offering discipline, fertility, and combativeness to our civilization during a time when the threats of great invasions were omnipresent.
1. This rigor, even if it made the cohesion of society strong, brought an obscurantist veil over the development of knowledge, which was nevertheless advanced in Europe thanks to the Greek and then Roman tradition. The truth of the Middle Ages found its power in a conception of the world leading to great morality at the cost of strong obscurantism.
1. Then, gradually, the European peoples' taste for knowledge resurfaced. First with the goal of seeking to better understand God's creation, so as not to oppose the Truth of the time.
1. From the Renaissance, the respite from the need to defend against invasions and the insatiable appetite for knowledge led to a renewed pursuit of the quest for knowledge initiated much earlier in Athens and then Rome.
1. The taste for science and the empirical verifiability of ideas returned, allowing the West to build its power on a great knowledge of the world.

***

6. For four hundred years, the West experienced an era of grandeur. The morals governing daily life and the dogmas protecting the family, social hierarchy, and the state persisted, while the obstacles to scientific knowledge and economic and industrial development were removed.
1. Governance structures changed to ensure more freedom, and this freedom, exercised within the framework of a still-present fear of God, served this people and its glory.
1. And thus, truth evolved, the memes transforming to meet the needs of the time, and man continued on his path, guided by the unwavering quest for knowledge and truth that allowed for sublime grandeur.
1. This grandeur was admired in the arts, in commerce, the formidable development of industry and productivity of labor, discoveries, and the strength of its glorious armies that succeeded in conquering the world.
1. This grandeur offered such success in conquest and global power that Western truths became universal truths, and its values became universalism, its way of thinking about the relationship between man and society and the state became universal human rights. Considering this as an eternal given would be a mistake, and this mistake has been made.

## **4**Post-Modern Deconstruction

1. The West ruled the world. In the name of progress, as science needed freedom to deploy its power, the dogmas of religion were abolished.
1. When men build, generation after generation, customs, rules, and hierarchies that reward them with the glory of seeing their genes perpetuated, harmonizing society and making it prosperous, they call this construction "Good."
1. Therefore, once God was abolished to clear the way for science to flourish, Good had nothing to support itself and was replaced by the naive formula: "what feels good," "what does not cause suffering."
1. Social constructs on which our good was built were then deconstructed in the name of the hedonistic right to individual enjoyment. The hegemony reached by our civilization completely obscured the necessities of maintaining discipline and a sense of duty to avoid extinction.
5. The world continued to offer its inevitable sufferings: the death of loved ones, the injustice and arbitrariness of powers, disease and disasters, famine and betrayal. And this naive conception of the world saw its resentment grow: the pain persisted, the misfortune continued to exist even though they sought with all their might what did not cause suffering.

***

6. The naive people, having lost all structure to give meaning to these sufferings, became indignant at their "right to happiness" being violated. They lost something even worse without realizing it: the sense of duty, without which nothing makes sense.
1. The fundamental naivety of considering that man, by following his instincts, desires, and empathy, by following "what feels good," would naturally go towards "the good" conflicted with a reality that was no longer that of the Paleolithic.
1. The bygone naivety of an era when man could at leisure leave a tribe where the patriarch was too restrictive of their freedom to live their instincts, to found a new tribe a few days' walk away where they could now "enjoy without hindrance."
1. This wounded, injured naivety became rancorous, and it was necessary to find culprits. What remained of "good" was taken to crucify it again with a vengeful hand.
1. Then the resentment turned into despair, despair into nihilism, and nihilism into destruction.
1. It was said that God was dead. All the values that supported our culture gradually collapsed, leaving the Westerners in apathy. The weak and the cowardly rushed to the heritage of our ancestors' values to invert the hierarchy.
1. Tolerance for their own baseness, vices, laziness, and selfishness became the highest value in their new morality of tolerance. Ugliness, filth, and vulgarity took the place of beauty because nothing should require discipline or high standards.

## **5**Morbid Nihilism

1. Men and women distanced themselves, forgetting their duty to unite and offer descendants to civilization. They began to fight incessantly for their respective rights to enjoy each other in a sterile power struggle. Naturally, they increasingly renounced transmitting life.
1. The few children who were still born were born for the wrong reasons: they were no longer born to "do good," the fruit of the will to fulfill the duty of bringing a new generation to the earth to propagate civilization, extending the culture and genes of a people into the future. They were now conceived to "feel good," allowing the enjoyment of the right to experience parenthood, and they were raised with selfish fulfillment and the "right to happiness" as their only horizon.
1. Naturally, these children were not loved. Most were appreciated and pampered, but many were half-abandoned, left weekly in the care of one parent while the other indulged in hedonism. This would not have been so serious if they had been transmitted the ambition to live and the courage to advance with discipline towards individual and collective glory, to propagate the good, to propagate their genes, and those of their parents.

***

4. In its final moments, on the edge of the abyss, this once-flourishing civilization, oriented towards life, celebrating weddings and baptisms week after week, inscribed in its foundational principles the supremacy of individual fulfillment above all, including what will always be the most sacred of the sacred: the pure innocence of an unborn child's life. They authorized and organized the killing of the unborn child at the threshold of life, on the simple choice of the mothers.
1. They were guiltless in acting this way, repeatedly told that fulfillment in all its forms and selfishness must come first. Several hundred million unborn souls of our people never saw the light of day. Killed quietly, without even the sacrificial value that barbarian peoples attributed to their pagan gods.
1. If there sometimes remains in us the burning feeling of guilt drawn from our genes, then let us weep for our cowardice and guilt in having allowed these souls to be sacrificed by the hundreds of millions in the name of personal fulfillment and the supreme well-being of the individual. May God, or His incarnation, the life of the genes that flow through us, forgive us one day and allow us to bring to life the diversity and richness that these hundreds of millions of lives would have offered to the world.
1. On the brink of the precipice, this sick giant, having destroyed truth and Good, fragmented into millions of small individual trajectories towards the pleasure of "what is good for me," set in motion the collective suicide of these meaningless existences, where nothing should disturb the gentle drip of drugs leading to euthanasia, the escape from a world of pain in a final chemical cocktail of well-being.

***

8. And these poor tortured souls, weary of a life where the absence of duty no longer allowed meaning to be given to the pain of existence, departed with the nihilistic satisfaction of having destroyed even the life that permeated their bodies.
1. Such a vision of the world did not last long. It died out in the fulfillment of its suicidal will, leaving no more traces than a short story. The thunderous crash of indignant vociferations and nihilistic resentment fell silent. The tombstones of this lost generation, without heirs, were never adorned with flowers.
1. And the civilization, which once illuminated the world with its splendor, was on the verge of collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, gnawed from within by a deep self-hatred, threatened from without by civilizations that had managed to withstand this nihilistic wave because they had not had to kill their god in the name of science.
1. Rivals began to shake the once-acquired Western hegemony, taking advantage of the collapse. Economically, militarily, and demographically, all of the West's contradictions were attacked by its former vassals.

# **Social Reconstruction**

## **1**The Conscious Alliance: The Science of Our Civilization’s Glory

1. For a new beginning to arise and renew hope for our people, it will not be enough to merely relearn the lessons of the past; we must scientifically justify them, accept their reshaping, and acknowledge that they can no longer lean on any superstition.
1. Our task is to architect, engineer, and implement social constructs that scientifically optimize our civilizational fitness. We must determine the optimal moral rules and create a scientifically considered dogma aimed at achieving our glory and evangelistically adopting it for our people.
1. Let us undertake this social construction with the diligence and ambition of those who build rockets, advancing in a grand social engineering effort.
1. Let anyone who doubts the feasibility of such a project remember the diligence and resolve with which our people adopted restrictive measures in the interest of all during the great epidemics of 2020. Let us maintain the conviction that our people are ready to adopt restrictive measures for the common good, provided that it is an independent scientific consensus, not the state, that establishes it.

***

5. This new alliance must be woven from the life that flows within us, which we understand and wish to propagate methodically and scientifically, in a rational quest for our people's glory.
1. The social engineering work for our glory will be rigorous, involving historical, statistical, and genetic studies, game theory, ethnology, history, theology, and social experiments. A continuous process of methodical moralization to offer the people of our world a complete hierarchy of values to guide their lives individually and collectively towards glory.
1. When our lives are individually and collectively on trajectories leading to glory, let us be convinced that they are happy, and that the pain of the journey will never be suffering, for just like the sweat of an athlete striving for the summit, the sacrifice made for one’s own glory is an offering to oneself.
1. Let us create here the scientific consensus of what is THE GOOD, and heal the West from its relativistic gangrene. For once we accept that THE GOOD is what is beneficial to our glory, our living expansion, it cannot be relative, just as there cannot be multiple definitions of the evil that opposes it.
1. We have languished in an era where the hegemony of the West gave us the illusion that the moral choices of a society are a matter of individual tastes and preferences aimed at satisfying everyone's hedonism. Today, this boomer mindset is over.

***

10. We needed the threat of annihilation under the weight of our nihilism or by other civilizations to rediscover and understand this; now it is evident: what is good is what makes us survive and shine as a people, what serves our glory.
1. Let us not deprive ourselves on this path to glory of the pleasure of enjoying what feels good, the pleasures that flatter our senses inherited from a time when following these instincts sufficed to achieve the fitness of our genes. Life has given us these senses, and it would be heretical to extinguish them when they do not contradict our glory. A demanding life requires rest and care for our existences.
1. But let us also relearn and especially celebrate the glory obtained at the cost of sacrifice and discipline, for it is through it that life manifests in us now, and it is only thus that it can be transmitted for centuries and centuries.

## **2**Propagating Our Glory

1. It will be necessary to conceive the rules of this gospel as those before it, so that following and respecting these rules are rewarded and provide superior fitness to those who apply them with discipline, and that these rules favor the fitness of the entire community because this is how peoples have always structured themselves.
1. The West will accept that its greatest goal is the pursuit of maximum fitness, for any human group pursuing another goal, whether it be hedonism, well-being, happiness, communion with nature, or the satisfaction of obscurantist gods, will be defeated by the power of those who pursue glory with method, discipline, and obstinacy. We will win because we are the only ones seeking this victory.
1. Sometimes detours are necessary; humans are more productive when joy is shared to celebrate the event: the path to glory cannot be solely the rigor of a disciplined barracks where cold efficiency reigns under neon lights; it will need flowers, festivals, and celebrations.
1. Today, thanks to genetics, biology, statistics, game theory, history, and all the sciences that intervene in human biology, especially the biology of human behavior, we have powerful tools to understand humans and their relationship with the world. Let us use these discoveries as aerospace engineers use the outputs of fundamental research to design and launch spacecraft that reach the moon.

## **3**An Individual Salvation

1. If one understands the essence of this gospel, one realizes that it is the life drive within each of us, Westerners, to construct this set of memes, these social constructs around all aspects of human life, to provide a guide, a support on which to lean, a moral backbone.
1. However, it is not pure collectivism; it is also a religion of individual happiness, as it ensures that those who obey these rules maximize their personal fitness, their glory, whether through their success and the radiance they can bring to their family for generations or by offering to a community containing all the alleles of their genetic heritage the most glory and fitness possible.
1. Anyone who has experienced the highs and lows of life can now realize that the moments they qualify as happiness were passages in life where their being was advancing towards maximizing their fitness: promising love, social success, a sense of usefulness to the world, joy of becoming a parent, grandparent, uncle, or aunt, warrior enthusiasm in the face of victory.
1. Conversely, depression is synonymous with periods in our lives where our fitness could not grow, where the advent of our glory was stalled by circumstances, and our will to live was put on hold, awaiting better days.
1. I announce to you today, these better days have arrived, for embracing this gospel, spreading its precepts, acting upon them in daily life, or contributing scientifically to optimize our discipline’s paths will bring you the happiness of knowing you are working towards your glory, the transmission, and expansion of the genes within you.

## **4**The People of Our Ark

1. This gospel was written by a human, a living being who obeys the laws of life flowing through them. All living beings wish to favor the transmission of their genes and put their existence in the service of this transmission. It is for my kind that this word emerged. This word aims to lead the civilization of which your prophet is a part towards glory, for the people to whom it is addressed are imbued with the alleles of my own genes. My glory is the glory of my people.
1. It is thus the very movement of life flowing through me, demanding its continuation, that compels me to offer this gospel, for I know that by proposing it to the world, my civilization will raise its head. Thus, regardless of the future reach of this act of faith in life, I place myself in the heritage of monotheistic prophets.
1. They did not have this scientific knowledge and proclaimed that God dictated their words, but I am convinced it was the sum of their genes' alleles seeking a civilizational path to the future when their people were in a dead end, without hope, under Egyptian then Roman domination. I am convinced that the same life drive I feel today as I write these lines animated them in their time and led their respective peoples to rally around common moral rules to ensure their shared glory.
1. The geography of human allele distribution has blurred borders, vague continental limits, and cannot be understood as unified blocks but only as a continuum, where the strong presence of a particular trait does not necessarily indicate the presence of a second. Therefore, it will not be about races, as it would contradict scientific verifiability, the scientific consensus on which our religion must now be based.

***

5. Furthermore, the real future history of each people will determine their relative permanence and prosperity over millennia. Only this actual future, in the end, will be able to judge the value of each people in their ability to endure and propagate their genome and civilizations. It is not up to humans to judge, for their responsibility lies solely in making their own civilization shine in glory.
1. Thus, anyone who recognizes the truth of this gospel can claim it. Let those who wish to pursue the aspirations of this gospel and show themselves capable of adopting its precepts, submitting to its doctrine, and accepting the hierarchies of societies that result from the discipline with which each works for our common glory, then they are one of us.
1. If the boundary between "Us" and "Them" runs through each person's heart, it would be naive to relativize it to the point of not allowing it to be drawn.
1. Anyone who knowingly harms this people and its efforts to unite for its glory obviously cannot be one of us.
1. And anyone who uses and abuses the efforts of the people uniting under this gospel's banner, wishing to reap the glory without being up to the community's efforts to bring it about, cannot be considered a member of our community. The same goes for those who cheat or contest the hierarchies formed by the discipline of each concerning this doctrine.

## **5**The Method for Glory

1. We have the duty to bring about the glory of our civilization by building fertile families, ardently defending it in combat, joyfully celebrating it, intelligently organizing it, and rigorously respecting the rules of this gospel aimed at our common glory.
1. The sterile and indulgent relativism of past times will cease. Our vision will become truth; the fitness of our civilization will once again become THE good, THE good for which we live without laziness, THE good for which we work with ambition and courage, THE good for which we sacrifice our lives, THE good that transforms suffering into an obstacle on the path to a higher goal, THE good for which we renounce the pleasures of celibacy to found families, THE good that makes us want to love and forgive the members of our community, THE good that erases before it any weaker vision of the world.
1. In our quest for the conscious reconstruction and reshaping of social structures that will make us great, divergences of opinion will arise. Let us beware of listening to any opinion that does not aim at the greatness of our civilization but at the well-being and right to hedonism of some of its fringes. Only the arguments of sciences seeking the glory of our people should be considered in our moral quest. To get back on our rocket to the moon, we have nothing to learn from glider makers.

***

4. Do not be ashamed, it is the nature of every living being to consider itself as necessary and central in its relation to good, first at the animal stage as "what does it good" because it allows its survival and reproduction, and now at the civilizational stage as "what is good for us". Let us assume ourselves, and firmly reject those for whom "living together" is reduced to defining the ways of personal enjoyment rather than collectively seeking glory.
1. Be assured of the validity of this approach, because the conscious and thoughtful approach, scientifically developed as a tool of social engineering for the power of our civilization, can only triumph over approaches based on hedonistic or obscurantist philosophies, or on social engineering of decadence and nihilism.
1. If we take the parable of the spaceship, it is certain that the most effective spaceship for going to the moon will be the one that was designed and built with that goal in mind.
1. Our theology will therefore be Teleology.
1. Let us spread THE GOOD, despite our congenital guilt of dominance, despite our modest and generous nature. Let us shift this guilt to other objects than existence itself, for it is the nature of every living being to elbow its way to ensure the survival of its genes as much as possible in competition with the rest of life.

***

9. Let us overturn this guilt, and feel guilty for every failure to work for our common glory.
1. Nevertheless, let us spread THE GOOD with decency and respect towards the rest of life. We already share many elements of our genome with the plant world, and even more with the animal world, and the similarity with our fellow humans is so close that their glory, as long as it does not hinder ours, must be supported and celebrated, for protecting the common alleles that run through their lives serves the life that runs through us. Our instinctive empathy knows this well and reminds us every time their suffering impacts us.
1. If we fail to forge this new alliance, and move towards the future with a worldview that is not a will to power and a scientific renovation of social structures ensuring our power, then the voice of our people will soon be only the whispers of slaves lost in the noise of their chains.
1. We aspire to a greater destiny, and we are ready for great sacrifices and great discipline to make it happen.

# **D**ogma

## **1**Foundations of Our Morality

1. Man, since the end of his Paleolithic animality, must discipline his aspirations and fears, be wary of his instincts, and adopt an attitude oriented towards the glory of his civilization to achieve his own glory, or see his civilization destroyed and his people enslaved. The purpose of the dogma presented here is to offer its disciples a hierarchy of values and a direction towards which to aim their disciplined efforts to achieve their collective glory.
1. The discipline required by men is a duty not only of control over their desires, wishes, and passions but also, and especially, over their fears. Overcoming the fear of losing, the fear of daring to assert oneself and advancing towards life with the ambition of one's own glory and the glory of one's people is a duty taught by this gospel.
1. The skill, courage, strength, and intelligence with which men subject themselves to this discipline lead to a hierarchy of society based on their competencies. This hierarchy reflects the reward of civilization to its most valiant elements, those whose talent brings glory to the entire community. It is everyone's duty to respect this hierarchy, avoiding any resentment towards success, and instead bringing an exemplary value to it. It is also everyone's duty to avoid unduly obtaining a position that does not reflect their contribution.

***

4. It is everyone's duty to aim to create the conditions for economic and political power that reflect these hierarchies with justice, by eliminating corruption. It is everyone's duty to fight the subversion of the most cowardly who denounce the injustice of an otherwise just order due to their position, which is only a reflection of their lack of discipline in contributing to the glory of civilization. If their discipline must be economic or physical coercion, then so be it, it is not for us to judge, but for Caesar.
1. The set of these rules is not intended to create a barracks or the coldest asceticism where joy and sensory pleasure never shine. All joyful manifestations of our Paleolithic animality that do not hinder our glory are to be celebrated and lived with a light heart. Each rule of discipline must find the path least distant from our nature, otherwise, this effort of discipline cannot be sustained; it is a matter of our glory.
1. The closer the demands of our order are to our nature, the easier it will be to find discipline. Valuing a discipline that goes beyond what is necessary for the glory of our civilization is a counterproductive heresy. Ascetics and other heirs of Victorian England have no place imposing a social hierarchy based on their extreme ability to renounce the life that vibrates within them beyond what is necessary for glory.
1. Those who understand the issue of sacrifice made for the discipline towards the community know that they are working for their own glory because the genes that compose them will be perpetuated by their fellow men. The true twin who sacrifices for his brother knows he loses nothing in the exchange because his entire glory will be carried by the beneficiary of the sacrifice. The elder brother giving a kidney to the younger brother knows it is his duty to offer half his chances to allow the survival of the one who possesses half his genes; the same applies according to the genetic proximity between each individual.

***

8. Those who sacrifice themselves in war know their sacrifice will allow a large community to survive and shine, and their alleles, shared within a large population, to be carried towards glory. Those who lead lives that do not allow them to directly transmit their genes to descendants but guide their peers on a virtuous, just, and good path know, as all members of the clergy know, that they work for their own glory through the community they support, as this community carries within it each of the alleles of their genes in hundreds of replicas.
1. Let those who cheat deliberately and wish to enjoy the prosperity of society and the glory offered by the disciplined efforts of their peers be stripped of our esteem. It will be up to Caesar to punish them and protect society from their vicissitudes.
1. Let those who wish to return to the path of everyone's glory and their own glory be forgiven so that they can once again serve civilization by being rehabilitated.

## **2**Men and Women

1. In broad strokes, men reason, women feel. Their fertile love engenders generations to whom their complementarity brings prosperity and protection on one hand, and care and gentleness on the other.
1. Man tends to be just, to set a firm framework ensuring social cohesion, while often lacking kindness and empathy because he sees and analyzes through reason, and can be led to tyranny by the coldness of his judgment.
1. Woman finds it easier to be kind, empathetic, and charitable, but often lacks firmness with injustice because her measure between situations comes from the empathetic echo she feels. She can be led to rage when her emotions overflow.
1. It is in their union and reciprocity that a just and good world is possible.
1. The discipline necessary for a life that leads to glory strikes both men and women through the suffering it imposes, the pleasures it frustrates, the distancing from what they feel is beneficial, and the necessity to impose upon themselves what nourishes their anxieties, with the specific challenge for women of facing the pain of childbirth and the responsibility of being a mother.
1. Man, as his anxiety is lesser, his feeling of emotions is weaker, and the lower intensity of his empathy allows him to be firm with injustice, can more easily bend to the necessary discipline in the pursuit of his personal glory through the glory of civilization. This is the meaning of the divine word in Genesis: "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life."

***

7. Woman has genetically evolved over hundreds of Paleolithic millennia where her survival and that of her offspring during pregnancy and nursing was relatively dependent on the involvement and affection of her partner.
1. The Western woman, even more so, will forever carry within her the desire to satisfy what is deemed good by her man, she who had to, during the harsh winters of the Paleolithic, be absolutely dependent on skilled hunters, whereas elsewhere in the world, gathering made survival possible for those who were cowardly abandoned.
1. Thus, nature, in its evolution, has given woman the desire to be appreciated by man, and the urge to behave in ways that arouse his attention, interest, and affection.
1. Both women and men have the capacity to rise towards the good through discipline, but it is in seeking the attention and affection of the disciplined man she admires, be it father or husband, working for his glory and that of civilization, that woman finally elevates herself towards the good and the glory of society. This is the meaning of the divine word in Genesis: 
1. "To the woman he said, 'I will make your pains in childbearing very severe; with painful labor you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.'"
1. When men and women drift apart, it is always the man's responsibility to take the decisive step towards discipline by turning again sufficiently towards glory. Thus, he will once again inspire desire and respect in the woman and make her regain reason, for then she will resolutely turn towards The good to please him.

***

13. If there is one thing each generation of men learns painfully, it is that the female mind, apart from the unconditional love for her offspring, is a compass instinctively oriented towards glory, and has no scruples in turning away from any shortcomings in achieving it: cowardice, weakness, and laziness make her flee.
1. It is a compass that can be deceived by narcissism, Machiavellianism, and a lack of empathy, and open the door to evil, but never will the door open to weakness, cowardice, or the renunciation of glory. When a woman's desire and willingness to devote herself are great, it is because the perceived prospect of glory is also great. Let us make women our compasses, and honor their intuitions, for they guide us towards the glory of our civilization.
1. If you are a woman and my speech does not resonate in your heart, then act in the direction of the glory of civilization as you see fit, and it will be up to civilization to judge if the path you take truly allows you to fulfill your duty to optimize our common glory, or merely a mask behind which you hide your hedonism and selfish choices. Remember that Marie Curie, like many female Nobel laureates, had fertile families.
1. If you are a man and in your heart you feel the pain of loneliness and idleness, chase away your resentment and seek to make your existence useful in maximizing the fitness of your peers. Thus, you will work for your own genes and their glory, and create the conditions for men and women around you to see you as a peer, and soon as a worthy spouse who can be relied upon to fulfill the duty of bringing children into the world.


## **2**Fertility

1. Our people must find social constructs that ensure a fertile society to prosper. The family, in addition to fulfilling this role, offers everyone an unshakable foundation on which to build their responsibility and connection to society.
1. The family must be reformed, encouraged, and not settle for the laziness of having few children. The number of children should become a marker of greatness that commands respect, the consecration of a couple's glory that contributes to the community's glory. Procreating all the children a civilization and a couple can nurture and make thrive is a duty. Avoiding this through laziness, hedonism, or lack of ambition is a moral failing.
1. Couples must strive to make their unions enduring because, in doing so, they offer their children the chance to benefit daily from two parents instead of one, can build large families where sibling bonds strengthen individuals, and provide a better future for each of their children than if they lived apart. They should cultivate their love, the bond that unites them, and the quality of their relationship by frequently renewing expressions of affection and tenderness towards each other without a calculative spirit, for in fulfilling this duty, they serve the glory of all.
1. When weighing the balance between working for the community and working for the greatness of one's family, one must consider the overall benefit to the community for at least the next three generations. Thus, if one more child represents a few years of time devoted to raising them that won't be spent serving the community through work, the work that the children and their great-grandchildren will do must be measured.

***

5. Here you can see that a very small number of professions merit not being set aside to work on creating the next generation, and the community will admire the greatness of your choices for the glory of civilization.
1. Hedonism and non-reproductive sexuality should return to the shadows of the private sphere: the pursuit of pleasure should not be valued outside of how it unites and prospers parenting couples. Only the animal world sees an identity between living out one's desires and finding one's glory.
1. Infertile relationships based on enjoying each other offer, once the initial passion has passed, only a tug-of-war to see if the pleasure derived from the other compensates for the sacrifices made for their pleasure.
1. This is recognized as a zero-sum game that leads two lovers into detestation and calculative suffering, gradually fostering mistrust between the sexes, eventually creating a world where generosity is absent from romantic relationships.
1. These practices harm the glory of civilization and should be regarded with the same disdain as drug use or gambling: a dopaminergic escapism leading only to nihilism.
1. Let us oppose this enjoyment of sexual and emotional use of others with the return of sacred sexuality. Let us take the risk of never sterilizing our loves again. Let us make love with the courage of those who know what such commitment entails, and savor a full and complete sexuality, where two beings merge.
1. Let us learn to love each other until the power of our bodies, inexorably drawn together, forces us to rise to the challenge of responsibilities. Let us indulge in this folly without puritanism and celebrate all who engage in it, for it is thus that the life that traverses us all is transmitted.

***

1. Let us build a demand from this risk-taking and the responsibility it will require, for once sexuality becomes sacred again, becomes a commitment, seduction can once again become a game where we show how we can rise to the commitment. Let us consciously and proudly make the demand on our potential partners a vector for each person to strive to put their life in order for the good.
1. Other avenues will undoubtedly emerge to address the need for our civilization to once again offer vibrant birth rates and stable homes for the children of our people. The debate is open, and your prophet, while uncompromising on the need for our morals to fulfill this objective, remains flexible on the solution, which will inevitably be found through a process of experimentation and measurement of results, a conscious social engineering process.
1. In any case, we must consider as sterile as their projects the morbid visions of gender relations that have not proven they can achieve a birth rate above 2.2 children per woman and stable families, or at least express the intention to do so.
1. It would be pointless to waste time playing the debate game when it is enough to watch their ideology fade away without leaving enough heirs to keep it alive through the ages.
1. Finally, since the times require addressing the subject, homosexuality being genetic, we have nothing to condemn except that the concerned individuals have a moral duty to make their existences beneficial to the community in other ways and must compensate for their inability to contribute to the glory of all through procreation.
1. In no case can the propaganda of hedonistic morals be tolerated. Infertile loves cannot be the reference point for how potentially fertile loves should be lived.

## **3**Work and Productivity

1. The strength of our civilization draws its foundation from the productivity of our work. Our intelligent and conscientious people are capable of great feats, and their taste for competition drives them toward a process of continuous improvement.
1. It is within the power of men to determine where the natural hierarchy formed by competence should be encouraged and where solidarity with the weaker should mitigate the effects of this hierarchy, for a civilization cannot find its glory if its lowest segments remain in total destitution, nor when competition in the pursuit of glory yields no reward.
1. Respect for other living species must be considered, as these other forms of life share many of our genes. Destroying them for the advancement of our civilization cannot be accepted with a light heart by anyone who defends the glory of the alleles of their genes shared with the rest of life.
1. The hierarchy that matters in this gospel's view is not the amount of money, although often, serving one's community effectively creates value that enriches, whether by bringing a little value to many peers or much value to peers who have themselves shown great value. What matters to our vision is the value in terms of increasing the fitness of our people, achieved with every action truly useful to this world and remunerative when the politico-economic system truly establishes a fair hierarchy of competence.
1. The imperfection of hierarchies built by men, the cheating, and the abuses they suffer will always exist. Every game will have its cheaters. It would not be just to use this argument to refuse to offer the best of one's productivity to civilization and indulge in laziness because our common glory depends on it. Similarly, any failure to ensure justice in the reward for efforts corrupting the system must be sanctioned because it harms everyone's commitment and the trust needed for efficient value creation.

## **4**Combativeness

1. Through war, we serve our common glory. In defending our territory, the necessity of sacrifice in combat is evident as it is immediately synonymous with defending the fitness of our population's genes.
1. The man who implements discipline in training to be feared by the enemies of our civilization and to defeat them acts resolutely for glory. He must discipline his ardor and his fears to become formidable.
1. In conquest, it must be studied to ensure that the glory found compensates for the deaths of our own, and beyond the deaths of our own, the deaths of men from the rival civilization, which remains a tragedy for anyone who loves the life within him. The life in the adversary is close to ours, and ending the transmission of these genes in favor of those of maggots and field rats must be considered very seriously by anyone seeking the glory of their genes.
1. Thus, the expression of pity, decency, and honor must always be present in our use of military violence, for indiscriminate slaughter and unchecked rampage destroying a life containing genes so close to ours cannot serve our glory.

## **5**Exploration and Research

1. Our people draw their strength from their curiosity, their desire to explore the world to know and master it, by exploring new spaces, new dimensions, or through the study of causal relationships existing in the world.
1. This curiosity is to be celebrated and encouraged, and the competition with which it is exercised creates an emulation that makes it flourish among us.
1. It is to be celebrated because it has the potential to offer us glory, like birthrate, productivity, or combativeness. Glory through the discovery of new spaces to propagate the life that flows within us, new technical possibilities to propagate life here, new knowledge to create the weapons to defend it.
1. The taste for science and understanding the world will extend, with this gospel, to the field of moral research aimed at optimizing our social constructs, our value hierarchies, and our dogmas to serve our civilization. May this gospel open a new domain of research and applied science: the social engineering of our common glory.


## **5**Liberties

1. The freedom of our people is the most beneficial organizing principle. It allows for the expression of competition that fuels our productivity and research.
1. The advancement of our science can only progress in an environment free from obscurantism where freedom of expression is guaranteed.
1. Our moral science, as outlined here, in its quest for what is just and good for our civilization, must arise from free debate and requires an open informational space for dissemination; thus, censorship must be fought in all its forms.

## **6**Empathy and Guilt

1. Empathy, a natural and biological manifestation of our agreeableness, makes our people a community of mutual aid and solidarity. It is a strength that offers a helping hand to those who falter, and it is one of the wonders of our civilization, foundational alongside science in all health techniques we have provided to humanity beyond our civilization.
1. However, like all natural passions that drive us, it must be disciplined: Empathy leads to the renouncement of judging right from wrong, leveling beings under their common faculties to feel joy and sorrow, and offering only the intensity of experienced suffering as hierarchy.
1. Thus, it must be critiqued and contained, like our other passions, for the glory of our civilization must take precedence over our primary animal feelings, whether they inspire mistrust like anger, sexual desire, or laziness, or inspire sympathy like empathy and compassion.
1. The feeling of guilt and concern for the future are also part of our nature. It makes our people a group where trust reigns, where the fear of experiencing the pangs of guilt precedes the fear of being caught. This is one of our strengths. Throughout time, we have felt the need to be cautious not to deprive our neighbor of bread, imposed by the survival conditions of our Paleolithic ancestors during their freezing winters.
1. But we must also muzzle this feeling and discipline it, as it tends to find imaginary objects of guilt even when we have done nothing wrong.
1. We must convert the potentially self-destructive power of this guilt into a positive force: guilt for our shortcomings in discipline leading to the glory of our civilization.
1. Finally, empathy and guilt, being characteristics of each individual's nature requiring no discipline, cannot be criteria by which men and women are hierarchized or recognized for their value and asserted within the group.
1. Therefore, I tell you, do not succumb to pessimism or guilt, for the future of our civilization, with its proven resilience, is assured.

## **7**Cult of Beauty

1. We celebrate life, in the biology of its natural selection leading to the perfection of its design, the perfect adaptation between external conditions and the expression of animal life, as well as in the beauty of our dogmas, traditions, social constructs, and material creations that enable the continued advancement of the glory of our genes since man has had to build civilizations to perpetuate his existence.
1. This fascination with the perfection of nature's and society's designs, their perfect adaptation to need, minimalist and coherent, parsimonious and elegant, is the manifestation of our love for life.
1. This is what we call beauty, and we must strive for art, cultural, and civilizational manifestations to celebrate this beauty, this demanding quest for perfection in design requiring discipline and connection to all dimensions of existence.

# **Our Church**

## **1** The Mission of Our Church

1. The aim of our church is to work towards the dissemination of this gospel, and beyond its dissemination, to strive to embed the values that guide our civilization towards its glory, towards its fitness, into society.
1. We must rise, discipline ourselves, and work to offer our regained ability to judge to a world that has lost all sense of what is right, and is lost in the hedonism of what feels good.
1. Members of our church aim for civilizational fitness and work for it through their productivity, by founding a family, through scientific research, defense, art, or moral action, and the dissemination of the dogma and its necessity within society. They take time for meditation every Sunday, before the mass, to reflect on their lives and evaluate if their recent actions align with the path to glory, and how to improve this for the coming week.
1. As soon as we have the strength, our first project is to combat extinction. Let us offer our civilization precisely what post-modern hedonistic nihilism fantasizes as the imaginary enemy of its unrestrained enjoyment. There is much more than obscurantist archaism or the strictly reactionary posture of a bygone era in everything they wish to censor and cancel: there is precisely the future that will overthrow their reign.
1. Let us observe the fears, worries, and cries of dismay from nihilistic post-modernism and embody as closely as possible the archetype of this vision that haunts it, for our vitality is indeed the antithesis of their projects.
1. Let them outline our being, using the exaggerated lines of their caricature to be precisely the bogeyman they dread.
1. Our doctrine will be harsh with morbidity and will not hide it, for it loves life enough to accept showing cruelty for its sake.
1. Like a mother bear defending her threatened offspring, we wish for a future for our civilization to the point of unleashing the shadow within us. And we will not be kind:

## **2** Abolishing Nihilism

1. Let us be those who expose themselves to hostility and violence because they know that in the courage to disturb the sweet decadence, they bring about the glory of their people. We will have to take risks.
1. Let us be patriarchs and moralizers, let us be the guilt of this world that forces each to open their eyes to their shortcomings and weaknesses.
1. Let us be those who tolerate no more, let us be the firm and unyielding demand that does not allow itself to be pitied.
1. Let us be those who grant neither credit nor merit to anything that requires neither effort nor discipline.
1. Let us be those who scoff at any assertion of identity that is not an expression of a way to put one's life in order for the glory of all. We do not care how you enjoy existence, and even less by what orifice; we will only recognize identity among us for those who work, the rest are just a mass on the sidelines of our common path to glory.
1. Let us be the truth that cries “the emperor has no clothes” and affirms that empirical experience is superior to obscurantism and the narcissistic relativism of the millions of micro-truths of “what brings me pleasure.”
1. Let us be those who demand beauty in art, music, and their lives.

***

8. Let us be those who discriminate, judge, and classify our fellow beings based on the morality of their behaviors; let us be exemplary and proud to thus offer glory to our people and a haughty look to those who revel in filth.
1. Let us be those who reassign women to their duty of procreation and those who demand that men abandon laziness and cowardice to work with ambition and fight to the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to ensure the future of our civilization.
1. Let us mock the rights of those who lack the will to fulfill their duties, reject those who demand before giving, let us be those who expose the narcissistic manipulations of the all-too-easy victimhood posture.
1. Let us be the relentless eye that unearths without naivety those who find excuses more easily than solutions. Let us be the marginalizers of those who must remain in the gutters of our civilization.
1. Let us cast shame on antisocial behaviors and their tortuous justifications that pass them off as virtues; let us be the gnarled stick that strikes in the middle of the road for those who lead our civilization to suicide and cry out "you shall not pass!"
1. Let us stand firm against the soup of relativism that dissolves everything, let us be inflexible. This doctrine is TRUE, reread the Genesis of this gospel to convince yourself. Defending the values of this gospel is THE GOOD, and all other points of view are enemies, FALSE, and EVIL not to be tolerated.
1. There is no citizen compromise to seek or find. No middle ground, for the middle ground between their suicidal hedonism and our thirst for life would be a scarified humanity.

***

15. Let us fight them as enemies. May they perish under the weight of their morbid nihilism, may their decadence be an end for them, and a starting point for us. The only acceptable debate we announce is the one on the optimal form that social reconstruction must take to guide our civilization towards its glory, its perpetuation, and its expansion.
1. Let us be the nightmare of nihilism, let us be the deafening fire alarm that resonates in the padded comfort of the palliative care room and brings the dying out of their sweet sedation; let us be those who bring back pain, effort, boredom, discomfort, and responsibility. Let us be those who refuse to increase the morphine dose at the next outrage at the suffering of the world.
1. Let us be those who do not allow positive self-image to be constructed by sending naked selfies, who do not allow the courage to go towards the opposite sex to be bypassed to truly meet, rather than staying in front of sterile screens.

## **3** Save the Survivors

1. Let us make the effort to discipline our hearts full of empathy to silence it. Bringing this message with sufficient impact to move the lines will require hardening our hearts, but let us not sink into the nihilism of tyranny in turn.
1. Our ambition is not revenge. Whoever works at this moralizing task must free their soul from resentment, from the desire to cause suffering in revenge for past sufferings. Let us forgive the offenses of this nihilism that sometimes robbed us of hope. Let us forgive it for having made us slip into it at certain moments of our lives.
1. We must make life in post-modern hedonistic nihilism uncomfortable to the point where it becomes uninhabitable, burn the elements of its comfort, turn off the tap of its drugs, destroy its means of distracting from the abyss of its own way of life, daily reflect back the mirror image of the decay it demonstrates.
1. We must make this contemplated collective suicide the most painful and violent end possible so that the terror it inspires leads back to life. Let us compel the enemies of life to commit suicide in baths of soda, let us impose that euthanasia clinics offer only the option of being devoured by rats or burned alive in baths of acid if necessary to save the maximum number.
1. But let us also open wide our arms and hearts to welcome into our church those who choose responsibility, let us extend our hands so that everyone may choose redemption at any time and in any place.
1. Let us be the sensitive ear and the comforting shoulder that will welcome the tears of those who choose the path to life, the choice to look at the disaster of their hedonistic and selfish existences with lucidity, guilt, and revulsion.
1. Let us offer to all those of our people the possibility to turn towards the glory of their genes and civilization; let us offer them the comfort and support that will allow them to reorder their lives and restart their bodies so that they can soon work for our common glories.
1. We have something more precious than all the rights to enjoy the fake hedonism of nihilism to offer them. Let us give them the duty to serve the life that flows through them and a direction for their efforts.


## **4** A Religious Practice, Not Political

1. There is immense wisdom in Christianity's rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's. By maintaining our autonomy from politics, we can afford to cultivate the uncompromising nature of our dogmas, the righteousness of our morality, and the purity of our scientific approach.
1. Politics, whether in the pursuit of power or its exercise, is a necessary game of diplomacy, compromise, alliance, power dynamics, and posture. If our dogma stoops to that level, it will inevitably lose necessary inflections. On the other hand, the rigidity of its principles will allow no political maneuvering and will either cause it to fail or lead it into battles it lacks the strength to win. Let us not fall into this trap.
1. Instead, let us offer a practice that allows for influence and networking, the promotion of our values, and the encouragement of those who uphold them.
1. The field is open, the path is clear, the aspiration of millions of young people for a framework that structures their efforts and gives direction to their discipline is present. They are divided into different political parties bickering over strategic questions without a tool to unite their common faith.
1. They are disappointed by the softness of Christian worship advocating humble resignation rather than firmly influencing the choices of a civilization in decline.
1. They are ready for long marches but are going around in circles on exercise balls from point A to point A. They already possess rigorous discipline dissipating on gym floors rather than working for our common glories.
1. They have the rage to win but only get numbers in a digital bank account. They are ready to spend hours in rigorous training, practicing life or combat on video games at ages when they should already be battling.
1. They sink into depression, finding no conducive direction to apply their discipline, and commit suicide, consumed by a loss of meaning and utility even though they have the strength to shine our common glory.
1. This people is ready, courageous, combative, strong, but dying of idleness. Let us offer them the goal towards which to direct their faith.

## **5** A Teleology in Motion

1. Despite advances in technology and faithful transcription of scriptures, we must work to ensure that this gospel is malleable. That's why its primary medium is digital and accepts contributors like open-source code.
1. Since it considers the social reconstruction of a religion for the glory of the West as an engineering task, let us have the tools for this engineering. You will find the link to the platform managing contributions to this gospel on the website.
1. Your contributions are welcome if they fall within the framework of this gospel: "the will to bring about a social construction of moral and religious order aimed at optimizing the fitness of Western civilization."
1. The clarity and accuracy of the historical analysis of the human condition of Western man until today presented in this gospel will undoubtedly be reshaped as archaeologists, historians, geneticists, ethnologists, come to complete, clarify, and source this gospel to further improve the narrative of the historical arc of Western civilization until today.
1. The dogmas will be updated based on developments in scientific research in individual psychology, evolutionary psychology, social psychology, game theory, biology, but also with the consideration of the impact of the initial measures of our dogmas on society in a continuous improvement approach to our glory.
1. The way our church works, its organization, its structure will also be subject to changes, with efficiency pragmatism in sight, this gospel is only the first step.

## **6** Recognize, Count, and Encourage

1. Our church will initially be built on the remnants of the Christian faith. The Sunday Mass is the only space, to date, allowing to stand up and offer, by its presence and rectitude, a feeling of strength to a whole community which, failing to truly seek the glory of our civilization, still wishes to avoid its downfall and limit the damage to the narrow circle of its faithful.
1. The Christian Church, however, cannot alone carry our struggle, our dogmas, nor contain the impulses of our worship. Its guilty self-flagellation, its sense of measured without audacity, the naive wait of hope it conveys, the remnants of obscurantism it still carries, and its silent humility cannot make it the counterweight that will save us from shipwreck.
1. Let us hope that the church will forgive us the blasphemous nature of this gospel. Let us be assured that at the very least, it will tolerate it after tolerating so much.
1. The task asked of those in whom this gospel resonates and who wish to make it their guiding principle is already to make it known, to share it, to talk about it around you, to become evangelizers in your turn. If you have been touched by the power of these words, then you will feel a turning point in your lives to align them, each in your own way, with the pursuit of glory.
1. A first objective, even before organizing your life to fight against nihilism or work, could be to share this gospel. Without laziness, resolutely, with the conviction that an action like yours, repeated by a community of faithful, will have an impact in the short term. So set yourself a goal: 3, 5, 10, 20 people? How many will you be able to get to read this gospel? Be ambitious.

***

6. Then, let us offer a way to recognize ourselves by adding the double helix of the DNA strand to our Christian crosses. This double helix symbolizes the common life that runs through us through the alleles we have in common.
1. Let us affirm this symbol by crossing two fingers to symbolize it and mark thereby our hope. Wearing this double helix of life in pendants, on our social networks as well as in the street, let us offer a simple distinctive sign marking our attachment to this truth and allowing the members of our church to count themselves.
1. This is important to, initially, emerge from isolation, to meet some friends on this long journey, which will not happen without the hostility of a world that just wants to die in comfort.
1. A symbol to come together and help each other to collectively overcome the nihilism that engulfs us and soon become a robust and supportive force.
1. Then, when we are numerous enough, let us start working in society to spread our precepts and dogmas, to apply our social engineering of glory for our civilization, to bring our thinking back to the universalist place it deserves.
1. Let us work through this religious practice for the glory of our genes, through our families, our communities, and our civilization so that at our death we do not have to worry about the posterity of the life alleles that have passed through us.

*Robin Caramaschi*

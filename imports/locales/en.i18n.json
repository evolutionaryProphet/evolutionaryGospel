    "modalWelcomeText2": "At the crossroads of seemingly opposing universes—evolutionary biology, Judeo-Christian tradition, and Nietzschean will to power—this work offers a new vision where genes, memes, and the principles of natural selection play a central role in the formation of civilizations, allowing for a rethinking of morality and religion in a new light.",
    "modalWelcomeText3": "It has the bold ambition to initiate the moral reconstruction that will allow our civilization to flourish anew and to put an end to the nihilistic hedonism that naively asserts: 'Good is what feels good.' It aims to provide an answer, perhaps even THE answer, to anyone who feels a loss of meaning deep within.",
